Hello there! I'm Christos Antoniadis

A 20-year-old programmer studying at S.A.E.K. Koufalion, where I’m honing my skills in software development and diving into the world of code. My goal is to become a backend developer, crafting robust systems and scalable solutions that power the digital world.

What I’m up to:

Learning the fundamentals of Java, Python, C, and C++ to build a strong coding foundation.

Developing my own game using Godot Engine, blending creativity with technical challenges to bring ideas to life.

Developing my own e-shop made with html,css,js,python flask and sql.

Exploring backend frameworks and tools to sharpen my expertise in server-side development.

I’m always eager to collaborate on projects, experiment with new technologies, or discuss game development and backend systems. Let’s connect and grow together!
