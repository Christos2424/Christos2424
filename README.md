Hello there! I'm Christos Antoniadis

A passionate 20-year-old programmer studying at S.A.E.K. Koufalion, where I’m honing my skills in software development and diving deep into the world of code. My ultimate goal is to become a backend developer, crafting robust systems and scalable solutions that power the digital world.

What I’m up to:

Learning the fundamentals of Java, Python, C, and C++ to build a strong coding foundation.

Developing my own game using Godot Engine, blending creativity with technical challenges to bring ideas to life.

Exploring backend frameworks and tools to sharpen my expertise in server-side development.

I’m always eager to collaborate on projects, experiment with new technologies, or discuss game development and backend systems. Let’s connect and grow together!
